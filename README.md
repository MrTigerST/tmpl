# tmpl

A Template Directory Manager CLI Software.


------------

### How it Works
Do you want to use your own templates on your projects simply by placing the name of your template in the Command Prompt? This is the right place !

**At the moment there are 9 types of commands to do on the Command Prompt:**

 > `tmpl create <template_name>` this creates a new template using the folder where you ran this command .
 
 > `tmpl get <template_name>` this uses a template you have already created, on the folder where you ran this command
 
 > `tmpl delete <template_name>` well... delete a Template you created!
 
 > `tmpl list` shows the list of templates you created.

 > `tmpl -v` shows the current version of tmpl installed on your computer.

 > `tmpl -u` check for updates on GitHub.

 > `tmpl import <template_input_file> [template_name]` import an external template that you can immediately use. In the template_name parameter, you must put the name you want to give to the template which, if left empty, will use the name of the Template File (another way to import a Template is to open the .tmpl file using this software.)

 > `tmpl export <template_name> <template_output_directory>` export your template to share it.

 > `tmpl help` show tmpl available commands (not really a command but it will still show you the info).
